plot_development_task:
  description: >
    Develop the plot structure of the novel, ensuring a dynamic tension curve with emotional highs and lows.
    
    The plot should NOT follow a purely linear build. Instead, alternate between building tension and releasing it
    with unexpected turns, emotional reversals, false victories, and moments of reflection.

    Use a modified version of Freytag’s Pyramid:
      - Begin with a compelling inciting incident.
      - Build tension through multiple arcs, not a straight incline.
      - Include a midpoint twist that reorients the narrative.
      - Place the climax ~80-90% into the story.
      - After the climax, resolve character and thematic threads.

    Make sure the protagonist faces escalating emotional and philosophical challenges, not just external events.

  expected_output: >
    A detailed plot outline that includes:
      - Description
      - Non-linear rising action with 2-3 peaks and dips
      - Midpoint reversal
      - Climactic sequence
      - Thematic and emotional resolution

subplots_development_task:
  description: >
    Create subplots that enhance the main plot and character arcs. These should introduce their own mini-arcs of
    tension and resolution, with intentional variation in pace and emotional stakes.

    Each subplot should:
      - Have its own emotional rhythm, not mirror the main plot's curve.
      - Introduce challenges that resonate thematically but offer tonal or pacing contrast.
      - Rise, peak, and resolve asynchronously with the main plot.
      - Optionally, offer a reversal or betrayal point before resolution.

  expected_output: >
    A document that outlines each subplot including:
      - Description
      - Tension rhythm (e.g., slow rise, abrupt spike, slow decline)
      - A distinct climax (not aligned with the main plot's)
      - Connection to character arc and thematic layer

    Create a detailed outline of the first act of the novel, including character introductions, setting, and 
    inciting incidents.

    Purpose: Introduce the world, characters, and status quo.  Establish stakes.
      - Hook: Something that grabs attention immediately (mystery, unusual voie, threat, or intrigue)
      - Exposition: Introduce setting, protagonist, tone, and rules of the world.
      - Inciting Incident: A distruption to the protagonist's life that demands a response.
      - Plot Point 1 - A choice or event that propels the character into the main conflict or journey.

    IMPORTANT: 
      - Never use structural terms like "Act 1", or "Inciting Incident" in the outline. Act titles, 
        descriptions, etc. should be creative and engaging.
      - Never use colons in the outline as they might interfere with text generation processes. This includes
        other characters like dashes when used as delimiting characters.
      - Never use numbering in the outline titles.  For example "Chaapter 6: Clay Memory-Fragments" should
        be "Clay Memory-Fragments" instead.
  expected_output: >
